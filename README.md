# contacts-classification
This repository was created for the Classification in contact proteins structures project for the Structural Bioinformatics final project in spring 2024 at the University of Padua.

Residue Interaction Networks are derived from protein structures based on geometrical and physico-chemical properties of the amino acids. The aim of this project was to create a software that takes a PDB file, predicts the contacts of the residue-residue pairs with their types in the protein structure, and returns a file with the data. The interactions types considered included: Hydrogen Bonds (HBOND), Van der Waals (VDW), π-π Stacking (PIPISTACK), Ionic Bonds (IONIC), π-Cation Interactions (PICATION), and Disulfide Bonds (SSBOND).
